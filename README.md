Important Notice

My name is Vitor Baraçal Guimarães, and this project aims to practice front-end development techniques, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, applied to recreating a web page.

This website was developed exclusively for educational purposes as part of the Basic Web Development I course in the Software Engineering program at Universidade Positivo, during the 1st semester. 
I emphasize that this website has no commercial intent or purpose of violating the copyright or guidelines of Nike. The recreation is purely an academic simulation and does not represent, in any way, an attempt to clone, compete with, or profit from the Nike brand.

Thank you for your understanding.
